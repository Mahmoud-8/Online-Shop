2. Click the "Add to Cart" button for an item you want to purchase. The item will be added to the cart, and the total price will be updated.
3. To remove an item from the cart, click the "Remove" button next to the item in the cart section.

## Future Enhancements

This project is a basic implementation of a shopping cart and can be further enhanced in the following ways:

- Allow users to adjust the quantity of items in the cart.
- Implement a checkout process for completing the purchase.
- Store the cart items in the browser's local storage to persist across page reloads.
- Improve the design and add more features to make it a full-fledged e-commerce application.

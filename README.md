## Project Structure

- `style.css`: The CSS file that provides the basic styles for the webpage.
- `images/`: A folder containing images of the items (socks, t-shirt, and shorts).

## Future Enhancements

This project is a basic implementation of a shopping cart and can be further enhanced in the following ways:

- Allow users to adjust the quantity of items in the cart.
- Implement a checkout process for completing the purchase.
- Store the cart items in the browser's local storage to persist across page reloads.
- Improve the design and add more features to make it a full-fledged e-commerce application.
